    "   1. Machine -> Student\n",
    "   2. looks at input data, makes predictions\n",
    "   3. Supervisor isn't very helpful\n",
    "   4. Tells student when wrong/right, hopefully by how much\n",
    "   - Practically, requires:\n",
    "      1. Lots of data\n",
    "      2. Need input data & answers(ground truth)\n",
    "         \n",
    "### Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "   1. Machine has examples, no answers\n",
    "   2. In ohter words, machine focuses on finding patterns in data, lots of data\n",
    "   3. Machine is trying to find ways to group data\n",
    "      - Can learn reduced key features of data\n",
    "      - For example, pictures faces -> eyes, nose, mouth, etc.\n",
    "   4. Can use to compress data, generate images, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "   1. No predictions\n",
    "   2. Agent in environment with states & possible actions\n",
    "   3. Feedback is whether actions/solutions worked well or not\n",
    "      - Observer evaluates actions\n",
    "      - Provides reward for choosing action x in state y\n",
    "      - Agent's goal is to maximize reward\n",
    "   4. Analagous Human Examples:\n",
    "      - drawing\n",
